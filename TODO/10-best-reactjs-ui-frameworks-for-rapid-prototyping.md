# Top 10 ReactJS UI Frameworks for Rapid Prototyping

I am exploring some React-based UI frameworks that integrate well with React components and can be easily inserted into your React projects with rich features.

Below is a list of UI frameworks compiled based on ReactJS (in no particular order), hoping the following content can help you quickly implement your ideas with ReactJS prototypes:

## Material UI

Material-UI is a rich set of React components based on Google's Material Design.

Among hundreds of UI frameworks, Material-UI is the most accurate implementation of Material Design.

## React-Bootstrap

Do I need to explain this? Undoubtedly, Bootstrap is the most popular UI framework here.

Bootstrap is one of the most advanced UI frameworks and can handle most of our tasks. This is the React component for Bootstrap 3.

React-Foundation is React components visually implemented with Foundation UI.

## Ant Design of React

Ant Design is a React library designed by a Chinese company (Ant Financial), based on their own project's design specifications. It is a set of beautifully crafted full UI components built with React and follows Material Design principles.

They are looking for volunteers to improve their English translation (for example, the time picker component needs translation). If you are interested, please check [this issue](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/1471).
